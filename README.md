# BattleTech Tools

## Purpose

This is a development fork of Jeff's Battletech Tools. This will be used to explore keeping the project going as a community maintained codebase.

## Development

Want to contribute? Here's how to setup your own development environment:

OS X:
- Install Homebrew
- Install Node (`brew install node`)
- Install React (`brew install react`)
- We use Python for some commandline tools, but it's not required. (`brew install python3`)
- Clone the Repo

- Run the following commands
- `npm i`
- `npm run start`
- Browse to `localhost:3000` on your browser.
