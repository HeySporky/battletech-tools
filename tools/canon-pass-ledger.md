# Canon equipment pass: ledger

One row per item checked. Status: **added** (new record), **verified** (record matches the book), **fixed** (record
corrected), **flagged** (needs a source or a decision; not changed).

Book abbreviations follow the newest printing: TM = TechManual 6th printing (2021), TO:AUE = Tactical Operations:
Advanced Units & Equipment, IO = Interstellar Operations (2016), SO:AA = Strategic Operations: Advanced Aerospace.
Pages are printed pages.
