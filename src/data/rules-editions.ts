/**
 * Editions of the BattleTech rules, oldest first, so a player can choose to build with one edition's rules only.
 * The Mech Creator's Rules Edition control is the first user: BattleMech.setRulesEdition() filters its lists and
 * reads its stats through the helpers at the end of this file.
 *
 * Each official record lists the editions it is canon in, in `editions` (empty when it never was): that list is
 * what an edition contains. `editionStats` holds only stats, with one key per earlier edition in the list: what that
 * edition prints, or `null` when it matches the previous edition that lists the record. `introducedInEdition` is the
 * list's first entry; catalog-editions.test.ts keeps the three in step. Custom and Munchkin records have no list,
 * and getRecordEditions() works one out. An edition is entered whole, from its rulebook's page images, before the
 * next is begun; `complete` says which are done. Never tag from memory or from OCR text.
 *
 * Stats are entered as printed, with one exception (user ruling, 2026-10-07): an obvious misprint is corrected,
 * and the entry's `errata` says what the book prints and why it was changed. Anything less than obvious stays
 * as printed with a note, such as the 6.5-ton 170 engine in Battledroids.
 *
 * The core rulebooks replaced one another: the Core Rulebook's designer's notes (CRB p.247) give that line and
 * its years for 1987 to 2001 and date the Second Edition box set to 1985. The other years are the copyright
 * dates on the books' own credits pages. The Third Edition (1992) and Fourth Edition (1996) box sets were the
 * introductory game sold beside the reference rulebook of the day (Master Rules, introduction: "The introductory
 * game in the BattleTech line is the BattleTech, Fourth Edition boxed set"), so each holds less than the
 * rulebook before it in this list. That is why an edition's contents come from each record's `editions` and
 * never from the edition's place in this list.
