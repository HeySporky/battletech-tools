These buildings must be placed at least 12” from either player’s home edge, within 12” of the center of the play area and at least 2” away from each other. The player with the Reconnaissance objective must scan each of the buildings to determine which are the objective. To successfully scan a building, an Attacker unit must either end its Movement Phase in base-to-base contact with the building and spend the Combat Phase scanning (in which case the unit cannot make any weapon attacks of its own), or by coming within range of any active probes it carries (including LPRB, PRB, BH, or WAT specials) and making a successful scanning “attack” against the building (use the standard weapon attack rules for this scanning “attack”, including modifiers for range, attacker’s movement, and intervening terrain, but ignore the building’s immobile target modifier). If hostile ECM capable of blocking the active probe type used for such a scan is within range to do so, the scan will fail automatically. If a building is successfully scanned, the opposing player reveals if the building contains an objective token. If a building is destroyed for any reason before an objective hidden within can be revealed, the opposing player must also reveal if it’s an objective, but the Reconnaissance player only receives victory credit for the now destroyed objective if the building was destroyed by their opponent.
