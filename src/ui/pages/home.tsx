                  <p>Each of these software packages are amazing tools! However what they lack is complete cross-platform compatibility and ease of tablet use. Sure, <a href="https://battletech.rpg.hu/mechfactory_frame.php">Mech Factory</a> comes close, but it can't be used offline.</p>
                  <p>Jeff created this app originally as an electronic Alpha Strike roster sheet, but it's grown into more.</p>

                    <h4>Author - NGCFells</h4>
                      <p>New on the <a href="https://ngcfells.github.io/battletech-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta test site</a>, from your reports:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Every builder asks for the era first, and the era decides which tech bases you can pick. The Clan tech base starts with the Clan Founding Years, not the Star League.</li>
                        <li>The equipment list shows only ammunition for the weapons you have mounted; tick "Show all ammunition" to see the rest. Ammunition sorts by weapon in every list.</li>
                        <li>A tonnage bar stays on screen while you add equipment, and turns red when you are over.</li>
                        <li>Sponsons are placement choices: you decide which weapons go in them.</li>
                        <li>Vehicle ammunition goes in the Body, and the vehicle armor diagram has a top-down outline for each motive type.</li>
                        <li>Warnings and small print are larger and easier to read.</li>
                        <li>The vehicle record sheet is now one full page with every table the official sheets print: hit locations, motive system damage and critical hits, plus the VTOL elevation track, the submarine depth track and the super-heavy, Large Support Vehicle and Large Naval Vessel tables.</li>
                        <li>The fighter record sheet is one full page too: external stores boxes for your bombs, the armor diagram, critical damage, pilot data, the velocity record and the heat scale, or, for conventional fighters, the ground map straight movement and fighter return tables.</li>
                        <li>The 'Mech sheet's heat scale now runs from 30 at the top down to 0, with an Overflow box, as on the official sheet.</li>
                        <li>Small Craft and DropShips get full-page sheets for aerodyne and spheroid shapes. The Small Craft sheet adds a crew and cargo box; the DropShip sheet lists weapons by bay with their combined heat and damage, carried fighters and Small Craft with their launch rate, crew data, the K-F boom and docking collar, and heat generated per arc.</li>
                        <li>JumpShips, WarShips and space stations get full-page sheets laid out like the Strategic Operations ones: weapon bays in capital scale with standard scale in parentheses, each facing's armor in squares with its damage threshold, structural integrity, K-F drive, sail and docking collars in the hull, crew data, critical damage, heat generated per arc and the velocity record. Damage marked in play is filled in on the roster's printout.</li>
                        <li>The battle armor sheet holds five squads to a page, as the Total Warfare one does, with the leg attack, swarm attack, swarm attack modifier, swarm hit location and transport position tables beside them. The roster prints its battle armor five squads to a page, and the creator prints a design with its alternate loadouts.</li>
                        <li>The conventional infantry sheet holds four platoons to a page: thirty numbered troopers with the damage the platoon does under each, the range modifiers out to its reach, and its movement, armor and skills. Troopers it does not have and ranges it cannot reach are blacked out. An oversized platoon gets a block for each sub-platoon. Below them are the leg attack, swarm attack, swarm attack modifier, non-infantry weapon damage and burst-fire damage tables.</li>
                        <li>The ProtoMech sheet holds a Point of five to a page: each block has the weapons inventory, pilot data with the consciousness track, the hit location table with its critical hit boxes and an armor diagram. The torso weapon roll names your torso weapons, and quads and Gliders get their own hit tables.</li>
                        <li>Buildings print on a Structure Record Sheet like the Tactical Operations one: structure data, the weapons inventory, a line for every hex with its Construction Factor, armor and what entering it costs, crew data and a numbered map to mark the footprint on, level by level. Beside the map are the building critical hits table and the building's Damage Threshold and damage figures. Long walls run on to continuation pages.</li>
                        <li>Airships and satellites get their own sheets, laid out like the Total Warfare Airship and Tactical Operations Satellite ones: craft data and weapons, the armor diagram, crew data, and critical damage with the thrusters. An airship's sheet adds the velocity record and the Airship Velocity Table, which gives the Thrust Points for each turn of the four-turn cycle. Fixed-wing Support Vehicles stay on the conventional fighter sheet.</li>
                        <li>The <i>Battledroids</i> tanks, jeeps and infantry squads print two to a page, in the style of the book's droid record sheet: an armor diagram or damage boxes, the unit's data and weapons, and the rules the book gives it. Beside them are the To-Hit Number, movement, terrain and target modifiers, the Tank Hit Locations, the Missile Hit Table and the tank firing arc. Missile launchers show their damage per missile.</li>
                        <li>Anti-orbital Long Tom ammunition, a Custom round requested on the Star League Discord by SmilingNid: it fires surface-to-orbit under the Strategic Operations rules for 2 points of capital-scale damage, 3 shots a ton. The Federated Suns built it after Edo, with a prototype in 3055 and production from 3062.</li>
                        <li>The Hailstorm, the towed artillery piece from the <i>MechWarrior 5</i> games, at the Apocryphal rules level: 35 points out to 12 mapsheets, with the rounds the other tubes fire. It mounts only on a Support Vehicle trailer.</li>
                        <li>For games with space forces, a space turn tracker in Play Mode: tick "Space forces in this game" on the roster page. It counts the space turn (6 ground turns each), tracks each anti-orbital Long Tom shot from firing to the space phase, and reminds you of the rolls for firing early and for resolving each shot.</li>
                      </ul>

                        <li>Every creator offers to save your design before a load, import or start over replaces it.</li>

                      <p>We've added the 3 formation bonuses from the Tukayyid campaign book: Phalanx Star, Rogue Star and Strategic Command Star. I'm convinced the last one only exists because of Phellan's Star Composition in the third Blood of Kerensky Book. We've also fixed a couple of bugs. Formation Bonuses will show up properly when you add a Force Pack to your force. Additionally, the Command Lance will show up along with all of the other formations for an empty lance.</p>
